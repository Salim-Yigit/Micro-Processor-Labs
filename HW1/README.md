In HW1, we have a locking system.   
Our password has 4 digits.  
Firstly we initilaze locking system as Unlocked and show in 7 segment display as "U".  
Then user enter a password and locked the system, we show in 7 segment display as "L".  
Also we have a master password which I have determined "9876".  
User starts using keypad. If user enter true passwarods which determined by user or master password,the lock is open.  
If lock is opened, 7 segment will be U.
